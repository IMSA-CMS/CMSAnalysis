Error in <TBranch::TBranch::Fill>: Failed to write out basket.

Error in <TTree::Fill>: Failed filling branch:Signal.pt, nbytes=-1, entry=846092
 This error is symptomatic of a Tree created as a memory-resident Tree
 Instead of doing:
    TTree *T = new TTree(...)
    TFile *f = new TFile(...)
 you should do:
    TFile *f = new TFile(...)
    TTree *T = new TTree(...)
